# Digital Design 2 : ECE 4514
This is the repository for my class at Virginia Tech on Digital Design 2. It features code made for the Altera DE1 SoC FPGA with NIOS II processor. 

In this class, we learned the following things:
* Synchronous Clocks used in a Finite State Machine (FSM)  on an FPGA
* Multiple Clock domains within a FSM and one-hot encoding (amongst many)
* Custom Floating Point Addition/Multiplication/Division implementation
* Dynamic and Static Power concerns and how to mitigate them (ex: clock Gating)
* Pipelined FSMs to perform addition of vectors to achieve highest performance
* Using OpenCL with the Altera DE1 to perform Sinc calculations
* Leveraging both an ARM Debian installation with shared memory to perform tasks on the FPGA
