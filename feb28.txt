Midterm review 3/1

No System Verilog.

Learn techniques of high throughput vs latency

Power
	control by clock gating
	rise time and fall time of signals (limited control)

Role of constraint files SDC

True (pipeline registers 6 instead of 5 stages)

False (4input LUT) It can be. A LUT can implement any function

Lease control = Leakage Power Consumption
